      <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Crop Diversification and Climate Change Adaptation in Low and Middle-Income Countries</p>
      <p>
        <em>My current research focuses on <strong>crop diversification</strong> as a strategy for <strong>climate change adaptation</strong> in low- and middle-income countries. 
        I apply econometric methods to analyze how diversifying crop choices can help farmers reduce vulnerability to climate variability and improve resilience.</em>

<p><li><strong>Financing Development </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Debt-for-Development in Practice: An Evaluation of Reprofiling and Education-Linked Swaps in Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
      <p>
      <em>  In 2025, Côte d’Ivoire faces an exceptional fiscal challenge, with debt service obligations exceeding XOF 4,181
 billion, representing 26% of the national budget. In response, the government adopted a dual strategy to restructure its
 public debt and preserve fiscal space for priority investments. This report assesses Côte d’Ivoire’s debt dynamics, evaluates the short-term effectiveness of its fiscal strategy, and examines how debt instruments can be leveraged for development outcomes. It concludes that while progress is real, long-term success
 will depend on disciplined implementation and stronger domestic resource mobilization.</em>   </p>

<p> <li><strong> Macroeconomic Policy </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Will renewable energies make electricity prices more or less volatile than in the oil era in Europe?.</p>
      <p>
      <em>   In the oil era in Europe, the shift towards renewable energies has the potential to reduce electricity price volatility. Renewable sources like wind and solar
 offer stable, low-cost electricity once infrastructure is established, lessening reliance on volatile oil markets. Regulatory support, including the Paris
 The Agreement and the European Green Deal incentivize renewable energy adoption, promoting market stability. However, integrating intermittent renewables
 into the grid poses challenges, potentially leading to short-term price fluctuations. Additionally, upfront investment costs may temporarily increase prices.
 Despite these challenges, continued investment and supportive policies can pave the way for a more stable and sustainable energy future, potentially reducing electricity price volatility in Europe.</em>   </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Keywords:</strong> <em>Renewable energy, electricity prices.</em>
